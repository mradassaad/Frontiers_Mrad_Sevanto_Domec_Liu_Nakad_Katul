\section{Introduction}

Gas exchange at the level of the stomata supports all plant life on earth by providing energy in the form of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) for growth and maintenance in exchange for water. Over the past millenia, as atmospheric $CO_2$ concentrations decreased ten-fold and an increasing number of plant species adapting to terrestrial ecosystems, the need to optimize carbon gain in relation to water loss arose. This is thought to be behind the adaptation of cacti to arid climates by using a different photosynthetic machinery denoted as Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis. CAM photosynthesis allows stomata to open at night, when temperature and the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are low so as to minimize loss of water. It is thought that the stomatal opening of plants utilizing C3 and C4 photosynthesis is also governed by water limitations.

In fact, multiple models grounded on stomatal optimization were put forward and tipped as accurate predictors of transpiration. The accuracy those predictions is crucial for climate forecasting. \textbf{Here offer summary of these models}.

While the assumption that stomatal opening trends are controlled by plant hydraulics is widely used in the plant community, there is a shortage of evidence corroborating this assumption. In this work, the effect of plant water use strategies (from conservative to aggressive) on stomatal conductance ($g$) and leaf water potential ($\psi_l$) is analyzed through a dynamical system perspective that allows setting multiple constraints. 

\citet{Manzoni2013} offer a similar dynamical system approach to the same phenomenon. Water use strategy is prescribed by assigning a 'carbon value' to the terminal soil moisture content around the rooting zone. This study is similarly framed with additional sub-daily measured forcings and constraints on water use such as neighboring tree competition. The results of this model are compared to actual measurements.

The work here answers the following question: to what degree does water use strategy dictate stomatal control during dry-down? In a recent review of the theory of optimal stomatal control, \citet{Buckley2017} recognize the importance of delayed benefits such as keeping soil soil moisture at higher levels for future use. 

The goal here is not to develop a stomatal prediction package but to explore whether plant hydraulic traits alone are capable of placing stomatal behavior anywhere on the iso- or aniso-hydry spectrum. 

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{The model}

\subsubsection{The soil layer}

The ensure the continuity of the water stream throughout the tree, we model three vertically connected layers: the soil, the trunk and branches, and the leaves. Each of these layers are characterized by a hydraulic resistance that is non-linearly related to water potential. Prescribing hydraulic resistances to these different layers allows computation of quantities regarded as indicative of isohydric to anisohydric behaviour. Such quantities include leaf water potential ($\psi_l$) and stomatal conductance ($g_s$).

At the soil layer, we model the water budget \citep{Rodriguez-Iturbe2007} as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:soil_water}
    \frac{dx(t)}{dt} =\frac{1}{n Z_r}(R - E - L),
\end{equation}
where $x(t)$ is the soil moisture in $m^3m^{-3}$, R, E, and L are the rainfall input into the soil, the evapotranspiration, and uncontrolled losses respectively in $m^2s^{-1}$. $n$ is the soil porosity in $m^3m^{-3}$ and $Z_r$ is considered the plant's rooting depth in $m$. $L$ contains both leakage losses due to soil drainage as well as competition from other plants.

We consider the effect of a drydown on plant stomatal response. During a drydown, there is no rainfall input so $R=0$. The resulting form of Eqn. \ref{eqn:soil_water} is:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:soil_water_drydown}
    \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f = - \frac{1}{n Z_r}(E + L),
\end{equation}
where f is the combined losses through evapotranspiration and uncontrolled losses in $s^{-1}$.

\subsubsection{Carbon gain}

The seminal work by \citet{Farquhar1980} for C3 plants details how carbon assimilation limitations are coupled with electron flow dynamics at the level of the thylakoids to obtain a photosynthesis model at the leaf level.
The model by \citet{Farquhar1980} for C3 plants is used to compute $A$ for different leaf conditions such as Rubisco activity and for different environmental conditions like atmospheric temperature ($T_a = T_l$) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). To avoid having to compute derivatives of a piecewise, potentially non-differentiable function, we use the method provided elsewhere \citep{Vico2013}. The adopted equation matches the limitation imposed by the electron transport rate at very high mesophyll $CO_2$ concentration ($c_i$) and Rubisco limitation at very low $c_i$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:vico_model}
    A = k_1 \frac{c_i - \Gamma*}{k_2 + c_i} - R_d,
\end{equation}
where $R_d$ refers to dark respiration in $mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$ and $k_1$ and $k_2$ are parameters determined by computing the limits imposed on $c_i$ described above and equating to the predictions of $A$ provided elsewhere \citep{Farquhar1980}. Namely, $k_1 = \frac{J}{4}$ and $k_2 = \frac{J}{4} \frac{a_2}{V_{c,max}}$.

To eliminate the presence of $c_i$ in equation for the carbon gain, we use the carbon supply function where carbon assimilation is modeled as a diffusion process:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:supply}
    A = g(c_a - c_i).
\end{equation}

Combining Eqns \ref{eqn:vico_model} and \ref{eqn:supply} and assuming dark respiration $R_d$ is negligible compared to $A$, one gets a formulation for $A$ that is explicitly independent from $c_i$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:A_noci}
    A = \frac{1}{2}[k_1 + g(k_2 + c_a) + g \sigma],
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \sqrt{(k_2 + c_a + \frac{k_1}{g})^2 + \frac{4k_1(\Gamma^*-c_a)}{g}}$

\subsubsection{The intermediate plant hydraulic pathway: roots, trunk, and branches}

Recent debates on the hydraulic architecture of trees have elicited support for the segmentation hypothesis first proposed by Zimmerman (ref). The basis of this hypothesis is that the anatomy of the water conducting elements known as conduits differs considerably from one plant organ to the other. Specifically, as one progresses against the direction of the gravitational field, one encounters organs that are more and more resistant to loss of conductivity as a result of cavitation. 

In this work, we approximate the vulnerability curve of the whole hydraulic pathway with a Weibull exceedance function:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Weibull}
    g_{p} = g_{p,max}exp\Big[-\Big(\frac{\psi_{p}}{\psi_{63}}\Big)^c\Big],
\end{equation}
where $g_{p}$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the plant hydraulic pathway, and $g_{p,max}$ is its maximum value that corresponds to a plant water potential of $\psi_{p}=0$. When $\psi_{p}=\psi_{63}$, $g_{p} = g_{p,max}(1-0.63) = 0.37g_{p,max}$. Finally, $c$ controls the slope of the Weibull function at $\psi_{63}$ and therefore its curvature. To find $\psi_{p}$, we invoke the hydrostatic assumption which leads to $\psi_{p}=\frac{\psi{s}+\psi_l}{2}$.

At the soil level, knowing the soil moisture content, we use the formulation developed elsewhere \citep{Clapp1978} to compute the soil water potential:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Clapp_psi}
    \psi_s = \psi_{s,max}x^{-b},
\end{equation}
and the soil hydraulic conductivity:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Clapp_cond}
    g_s = g_{s,max}x^{2b+3},
\end{equation}
where $b$ is an empirical parameter dependent on the soil type. $\psi_{s,max}$ and $g_{s,max}$ are the soil water potential and hydraulic conductivity at saturation, respectively.

At the leaf level, the conservation of water mass is invoked to obtain an expression for the leaf water potential $\psi_{l}$. At steady state, the water lost through the leaves is equal to that flowing through the plant water pathway, therefore:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: mass_cons}
        \begin{split}
        E & = \text{LAI }\, g_l\, \text{VPD} \\
        & = g_{p,max}\, \text{exp}\Big[-\Big(\frac{\psi_{p}}{\psi_{63}}\Big)^c\Big](\psi_s-\psi_l) = g_p (\psi_s-\psi_l) .
        \end{split}
\end{equation}
Solving the above equation results in the value of $\psi_l$.

\subsubsection{Optimization and delayed gains}

To find the optimal trends of $g_s$ and $\psi_l$ with time at different environmental conditions, the method of calculus of variations is used to derive the necessary differential equations (Appendix A). The objective function $J$ in this situation is the following:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:objective}
    J = \int_0^{T_f}\big[ A(g_l,T,R_{abs}) + \lambda f(x,g_l)\big] dt + J_{T_f},
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the instantaneous plant carbon gain in $molm^{-2}s^{-1}$. $T$ is the atmospheric temperature in $K$, considered equal to the leaf temperature (Appendix B) and $R_{abs}$ is the absorbed radiation in $Wm^{-2}$. $J_{T_f}$ is the carbon value of the terminal soil water moisture $x(T_f)$ prescribed as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:terminal_gain}
    J_{T_f} = \Lambda x(T_f),
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is a user-defined parameter, in $mol m^{-2}$, prescribing conservative water use strategy when it is large and aggressive water use when it is small. This approach departs from the assumption that carbon gain trends are instantaneously optimal for all plants and. The presence of $J_{T_f}$ in Eqn. \ref{eqn:objective} represents in opportunity cost, measured in carbon gain units, of depleting the soil of water. The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ commonly referred to as the marginal water use efficiency (MWUE) and $f$ is the cost function obtained through eqn \ref{eqn:soil_water_drydown}.

The optimal solution for the leaf stomatal conductance $g_l$ is obtained by solving the following simultaneous equations (Appendix A):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: dg}
    \frac{\partial H}{\partial g} = \frac{\partial A}{\partial g} + \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}=0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: dlam}
    \frac{d\lambda}{dt} = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = - \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial x},
\end{equation}
in conjunction with eqn \ref{eqn:soil_water}.

The work here neglects high-frequency (sub-minute time scale) changes in environmental variables such as temperature and wind as well as those happening over multiple months such as changes in leaf nitrogen. The are thought not to have an appreciable effect on stomatal control over the timescale of a few weeks that is considered.

By tweaking the prescribed vulnerability curve for the same long-term strategy ($\Lambda$), and vice versa, it is possible to discern their effect on optimal stomatal behavior. 

We assume this is the global maximum

\subsection{Environmental data} 

The model requires supplying environmental data acting as boundary conditions at the soil and leaf levels. These are the initial soil water content ($x_0$), vapor pressure deficit ($VPD$), incident leaf shortwave radiation ($R_l$), and temperature ($T$). We use the data provided by the FLUXNET project at the Blodgett forest. A drydown period starting on May 29, 2005 was chosen and the environmental variations over 20 days are averaged into one representative day. These conditions are then copied and tiled to however many days the optimization is running for. This allows isolating the plant hydraulic and strategy effects on stomatal behavior.

\section{Results}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Fig1.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Hydraulic limits on $\lambda$. Vulnerability Curve (VC) alterations affect the lower limit on $\lambda$. These alterations consist of changing the normalizing pressure $\psi_{63}$ and the slope $s$ of the VC (see equation \ref{eqn:Weibull}). All of the shown curves are subject to environmental conditions at 12:00. The combination of VPD, temperature, and PAR at that time are the most stringent of any combination at another time throughout the day over the course of the considered drydown.}\label{fig:lam_lower}
\end{figure}

Soil-to-leaf plant hydraulics, prescribed through a Vulnerability Curve (VC), set a lower limit on the value of the marginal use efficiency $\lambda$ and dictate its increase as the soil moisture content decreases.

The former of these two effects is shown in figure \ref{fig:lam_lower} where the lower bound of $\lambda$ ($\lambda_{lower}$) is plotted as a functions of soil water potential. This arises from the solution of equation \ref{eqn: dg} upon replacing A using equation \ref{eqn:A_noci}. The solution provides an inverse functional relationship between $g_l$ and $\lambda$. At every $\psi_x$, equation \ref{eqn: mass_cons} is maximized to obtain an upper bound on $g_l$ which translates into a lower bound on $\lambda$. Because the maximum possible transpiration rate $E$ decreases as $\psi_x$ increases, $\lambda_{lower}$ increases with $\psi_x$.

The latter of these two effects is imposed through equation \ref{eqn: dlam}. In the simple case where no uncontrolled losses from the soil are present, $f=-E$ and therefore $\frac{d\lambda}{dt}=\lambda \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}$. Taking the partial derivative by $x$ of equation \ref{eqn: mass_cons} yields the following positively valued equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = g_p \Big(-\frac{\partial \psi_x}{\partial x}\Big) \Big[\frac{1}{2} \frac{s}{\psi_{63}} \Big(\frac{\psi_p}{\psi_{63}}\Big)^{s-1} (\psi_l-\psi_x) + 1\Big]
\end{equation}
\section{Discussion}

The purpose of this work is to elucidate the connection of stomatal response to plant hydraulics and water-use strategy. Plant hydraulics was shown to set a lower limit for the marginal water-use efficiency ($\lambda$) whereas the upper limit is set by a ratio of atmospheric supply of carbon to atmospheric demand of water (figure \ref{fig:lam_lower}).

Connecting the concepts of isohydry and anisohydry to plant hydraulics represents a crucial next step toward improving stomatal response modelling. 

There is evidence for the evolutionary coordination between hydraulic traits and photosynthetic rate \citep{Scoffoni2016}.
