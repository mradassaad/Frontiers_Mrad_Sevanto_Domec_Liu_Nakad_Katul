\section{Introduction}

Gas exchange at the level of the stomata supports all plant life on earth by providing energy in the form of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) for growth and maintenance in exchange for water. Over the past millenia, as atmospheric $CO_2$ concentrations decreased ten-fold and an increasing number of plant species adapting to terrestrial ecosystems, the need to optimize carbon gain in relation to water loss arose. This is thought to be behind the adaptation of cacti to arid climates by using a different photosynthetic machinery denoted as Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis. CAM photosynthesis allows stomata to open at night, when temperature and the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are low so as to minimize loss of water. It is thought that the stomatal opening of plants utilizing C3 and C4 photosynthesis is also governed by water limitations.

In fact, multiple models grounded on stomatal optimization were put forward and tipped as accurate predictors of transpiration. The accuracy those predictions is crucial for climate forecasting. \textbf{Here offer summary of these models}.

While the assumption that stomatal opening trends are controlled by plant hydraulics is widely used in the plant community, there is a shortage of evidence corroborating this assumption. In this work, the effect of plant water use strategies (from conservative to aggressive) on stomatal conductance ($g$) and leaf water potential ($\psi_l$) is analyzed through a dynamical system perspective that allows setting multiple constraints. 

\citet{Manzoni2013} offer a similar dynamical system approach to the same phenomenon. Water use strategy is prescribed by assigning a 'carbon value' to the terminal soil moisture content around the rooting zone. This study is similarly framed with additional sub-daily measured forcings and constraints on water use such as neighboring tree competition. The results of this model are compared to actual measurements.

The work here answers the following question: to what degree does water use strategy dictate stomatal control during dry-down? In a recent review of the theory of optimal stomatal control, \citet{Buckley2017} recognize the importance of delayed benefits such as keeping soil soil moisture at higher levels for future use. 

The goal here is not to develop a stomatal prediction package but to explore whether plant hydraulic traits alone are capable of placing stomatal behavior anywhere on the iso- or aniso-hydry spectrum. 

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Theory}

The principle adopted here is that plants maximize their carbon gain ($A$) over the period of a drydown. This principle assumes that plants freely control the stomatal conductance $g_s$. Previous work constrained control of $g_s$ by enforcing instantaneous water balance at the soil level \citep{Manzoni2013}. To mathematically express this constraint an augmented Lagrangian is defined $L$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Lagrangian}
    L\Big(g_s, x, \frac{dx}{dt}, \lambda, t\Big) = A(g_s, t) - \lambda \Bigg[ \frac{dx}{dt} - f_e\Big(g_s, x, \frac{dx}{dt}, t\Big)\Bigg].
\end{equation}
$\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier, $x$ is the soil moisture, $t$ is time, and $f_e$ is the soil water balance.

Because the principle states that $A$ is maximized over a drydown, the objective function $J$ is the integral of $L$ from $t=0$ at the beginning of drydown to $t=T$ at the end of it:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Objective}
    J\Big(g_s, x, \frac{dx}{dt}, \lambda, t\Big) = \int_0^T L\Big(g_s, x, \frac{dx}{dt}, \lambda, t\Big).
\end{equation}

The goal then consists of finding the function of $g_s$ in terms of $t$ that maximizes $J$. This goal is achieved by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations using the method of the calculus of variations. A required step however is expressing $A$ and $f_e$ in terms of the control variable $g_s$ and the state variable $x$.

\subsection{Carbon gain}

The seminal work by \citet{Farquhar1980} expresses carbon assimilation, or biochemical demand of carbon $A_{demand}$, for a C3 leaf as either limited by the Rubisco enzyme activity under saturated incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) or by ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (RuBP) activity under limiting incoming PAR. 
To avoid the use of non-linear functions such as the minimum between two number as well as ad-hoc parameters that might remedy this non-linearity, we adopt an accurate approximation to $A_{demand}$ \citep{Vico2013}. $A_{demand}$ is approximated using a hyperbolic function:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:vico_model}
    A_{demand} = k_1 \frac{c_i - \Gamma^*}{c_i + k_2},
\end{equation}
where $c_i$ is the carbon concentration inside the leaf. $k_1$ and $k_2$ are parameters determined by asymptotic limits imposed on $c_i$ described in \citet{Vico2013}. Namely, $k_1 = \frac{J}{4}$ and $k_2 = \frac{J}{4} \frac{a_2}{V_{c,max}}$. $\Gamma^*$ is the carbon compensation point which is the concentration of $c_i$ where carbon assimilation comes to a halt.

Equation \ref{eqn:vico_model} is of a Michaelis-Menten type where $k_1$ is interpreted as the maximum rate of carbon assimilation and $k_2$ prescribes the strength of carboxylation compared to oxygenation through $a_2$. Specifically, $a_2 = K_c (1+O_a/K_o)$ where $K_c$ and $K_o$ are Michaelis-Menten constants for CO$_2$ and O$_2$ respectively and $O_a$ is the atmospheric concentration of O$_2$.

The parameters of equation \ref{eqn:vico_model} ($V_{c,max}$, $\Gamma^*$, $K_c$, $K_o$) are temperature $T_a$ dependent while $J$ is both $T_a$ and PAR dependent \citep{Medlyn2002}. The dependence of $K_c$ and $K_o$ to $T_a$ is that of tobacco \citep{Bernacchi2001} and that of $\Gamma^*$ to $T_a$ is that of spinach reported elsewhere \citep{Brooks1985}. The dependence of $J$ and $V_{c,max}$ to $T_a$ is that of fertilized Pinus radiata \citep{Medlyn2002}.

The approximations used for $A_{demand}$ in equation \ref{eqn:vico_model} neglect: 1) the potential limitation by sucrose synthesis, 2) the contribution by dark respiration to $A_{demand}$, and 3) the temperature buffering effect of the leaf boundary layer such that leaf temperature is equal to atmospheric temperature $T_a$.

Furthermore, it is enforced that every CO$_2$ molecule captured from the atmosphere by the leaf is assimilated such that $A_{demand} = A_{supply}$. The supply of carbon from the atmosphere is modeled as a Fickian diffusion process through the stomatal opening:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:supply}
    A_{supply} = g_s(c_a - c_i),
\end{equation}
where $c_a$ is the atmospheric concentration of CO$_2$.

Combining equations \ref{eqn:vico_model} and \ref{eqn:supply}, a formulation for $A$ in terms of $g_s$ that is explicitly independent from $c_i$ is obtained:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:A_noci}
    A = \frac{1}{2}[k_1 + g_s(k_2 + c_a) - \sigma],
\end{equation}
where $\sigma = \sqrt{[(k_2 + c_a)g_s + k_1]^2 + 4k_1 g_s (\Gamma^*-c_a)}$

To sum up, if changes of $T_a$ and PAR with time are given, as well as $c_a$ and $O_a$, then $g_s$ is the only independent variable in equation \ref{eqn:A_noci}.

\subsection{Soil water balance}

% The ensure the continuity of the water stream throughout the tree, we model three vertically connected layers: the soil, the trunk and branches, and the leaves. Each of these layers are characterized by a hydraulic resistance that is non-linearly related to water potential. Prescribing hydraulic resistances to these different layers allows computation of quantities regarded as indicative of isohydric to anisohydric behaviour. Such quantities include leaf water potential ($\psi_l$) and stomatal conductance ($g_s$).

At the soil, we model the water budget as follows \citep{Rodriguez-Iturbe2007}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:soil_water}
    \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f_e\Big(g_s, x, \frac{dx}{dt}, t\Big) = \frac{1}{n Z_r}[- E(g_s, t) - U(x, t)],
\end{equation}
where $x(t)$ is the soil moisture in m$^3$ m$^{-3}$, $U$ are uncontrolled losses (independent of the leaf), and E is the evapotranspiration rate from the leaf in $m^2d^{-1}$. $n$ is the soil porosity in m$^3$ m$^{-3}$ and $Z_r$ is the effective plant rooting depth in $m$. $U$ may account for both soil leakage away from the rooting zone and competition from other plant roots. $f_e$ was previously introduced in equation \ref{eqn:Lagrangian}. Missing in equation \ref{eqn:soil_water} is the rainfall input and this is because we are only considering drydown periods in this work. Soil leakage is modeled as free drainage such that water losses from leakage per unit soil area and per unit depth is equal to the soil conductivity $g_x$ \citep{campbell1974}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:soil_cond}
    g_x = g_{x,sat}x^{2b+3}.
\end{equation}
$g_{x,sat}$ is the soil conductivity at saturation and $b$ is the non-linearity parameter. Both of these parameters depend on soil type \citep{Clapp1978}. From the soil moisture, one could also compute the soil water potential ($\psi_x$):
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Clapp_pot}
    \psi_x = \psi_{x,sat}x^{-b},
\end{equation}
where $\psi_{x,sat}$ is the soil water potential at saturation.

\subsection{Leaf-level water balance}

As a point of departure from previous analyses based on the carbon gain maximization principle, it is recognized that plant transpiration is limited by the the plant hydraulic architecture. This limitation imposes an upper bound on $g_s$. 

% Recent debates on the hydraulic architecture of trees have elicited support for the segmentation hypothesis first proposed by Zimmerman (ref). The basis of this hypothesis is that the anatomy of the water conducting elements known as conduits differs considerably from one plant organ to the other. Specifically, as one progresses against the direction of the gravitational field, one encounters organs that are more and more resistant to loss of conductivity as a result of cavitation. 

The loss of conductivity function of the whole plant with respect to plant water potential $\psi_p$ is known as a vulnerability curve. We approximate the vulnerability curve of the whole hydraulic pathway (roots, trunk, and branches) with a Weibull exceedance function such that:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:root_leaf}
    g_{rl} = g_{rl,max}exp\Big[-\Big(\frac{\psi_{p}}{\psi_{63}}\Big)^c\Big],
\end{equation}
where $g_{rl}$ is the root to leaf hydraulic conductivity (the whole plant), and $g_{rl,max}$ is its maximum value at saturation. $\psi_{63}$ is the water potential at which the plant loses about 63\% of its conductivity. Finally, $c$ controls the slope of the Weibull function at $\psi_{63}$ and therefore its curvature. To find $\psi_{p}$, we invoke the hydrostatic approximation between leaves and roots which leads to $\psi_{p}=\frac{\psi{r}+\psi_l}{2}$ where $\psi_r$ is the root water potential.

To find $\psi_r$, we define the soil to root conductivity $g_{sr}$. $g_{sr}$ is assumed to be the conductivity of the soil $g_x$ but over the distance between soil and root $l_{sr}$. $l_{sr} = \sqrt{d_r Z_r \text{RAI}}$ where $d_r$ is the fine root diamter in m and RAI is the root area index \citep{Manzoni2013}. If $g_x$ is given in m d$^{-1}$, then
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:soil_root}
    g_{sr} = \frac{g_x}{\text{grav} l_{sr}}. 
\end{equation}
Because the soil to root distance is taken into account in $g_{sr}$, one only needs to multiply $g_{sr}$ by the water potential different between root and soil to get the volume flux of water.

Therefore, we can express $E$ at multiple levels as follows
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: mass_cons}
        \begin{split}
        E & = E_{demand} = 1.6 \text{LAI }\, g_s\, \text{VPD} \\
        & = E_{sr} = g_{sr}(\psi_s)*(\psi_s - \psi_r)\\
        & = E_{rl} = g_{rl}(\psi_r,\psi_l)*(\psi_r - \psi_l) \\
        & = E_{sl} = \Bigg(\frac{1}{g_{sr}(\psi_s)} + \frac{1}{g_{rl}(\psi_r,\psi_l)}\Bigg)^{-1}*(\psi_s - \psi_l).
        \end{split}
\end{equation}
$E_{demand}$ is the atmospheric demand of water, $E_{sr}$ is the soil to root water supply, $E_{rl}$ is the root to leaf supply, and $E_{sl}$ is to soil to leaf supply.

From equation \ref{eqn: mass_cons}, as $g_s$ varies with time, $\psi_l$ also varies to match supply and demand. The hydraulic constraint from plant water supply is apparent when one realizes that while $E_{demand}$ is monotonous and increasing with $g_s$, water supply is not monotonous with respect to $\psi_l$ (equations \ref{eqn:root_leaf}, \ref{eqn: mass_cons}). The presence of a maximum water supply imposes an additional constraint on the stomatal conductance $g_s$. 

This additional constraint could be imposed with the help of another Lagrange multiplier. However, to maintain familiarity with the traditional definition of the marginal water use efficiency \citep{cowan1977}, this additional constraint is imposed differently here. Specifically, if maximizing $J$ (equation \ref{eqn:Objective}) leads to a $g_s$ that exceeds the maximum achievable $E_{sl}$ at current $x$, then this $g_s$ is replaced artificially by finding the maximum transpiration rate \Big(at $\frac{\partial E_{sl}}{\partial \psi_l} = 0$\Big). 
\subsection{Maximizing the objective}

To maximize $J$ (equation \ref{eqn:Objective}), we use the method of the calculus of variations \citep{witelski2015} to derive what are known as the Euler-Lagrange equations (see equation 3.55 in the mentioned reference). For this problem, these are a set of three equations to be solved with two boundary conditions set on $x$ at the beginning of drydown $t=0$ and at the end of it $t=T$.

The control equation,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:control}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial g_s} = \frac{\partial A}{\partial g_s} + \lambda \frac{\partial f_e}{\partial g_s} = 0,
\end{equation}
gives a monotonic inverse relation between $\lambda$ and $g_s$ (Appendix A).

The co-state equation is $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} - \frac{d}{dt} \Big(\frac{\partial L}{\partial x'} \Big) = 0$, where $x'= \frac{dx}{dt}$. The co-state equation yields the time variation of $\lambda$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:co_state}
    \frac{d \lambda}{dt} = \frac{\partial A}{\partial x} + \lambda \frac{\partial f_e}{\partial x} = \lambda \frac{\partial U}{\partial x}.
\end{equation}

Finally, the sate equation, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$ gives the soil water balance (equation \ref{eqn:soil_water}). 

Of equal importance are the boundary conditions: equations \ref{eqn:control}, \ref{eqn:co_state}, and \ref{eqn:soil_water} are to be solved with preset $x(t=0)$ and $x(t=T)$. In reality, it is impossible to set the terminal soil moisture a priori. However, this can be mended by introducing the water use strategy (WUS).

\subsection{Water use strategy}

To find the optimal trends of $g_s$ and $\psi_l$ with time at different environmental conditions, the method of calculus of variations is used to derive the necessary differential equations (Appendix A). The objective function $J$ in this situation is the following:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:objective}
    J = \int_0^{T_f}\big[ A(g_l,T,R_{abs}) + \lambda f(x,g_l)\big] dt + J_{T},
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the instantaneous plant carbon gain in $molm^{-2}s^{-1}$. $T$ is the atmospheric temperature in $K$, considered equal to the leaf temperature (Appendix B) and $R_{abs}$ is the absorbed radiation in $Wm^{-2}$. $J_{T_f}$ is the carbon value of the terminal soil water moisture $x(T_f)$ prescribed as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:terminal_gain}
    J_{T} = \Lambda x(T),
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is a user-defined parameter, in mol m$^{-2}$, prescribing conservative water use strategy when it is large and aggressive water use when it is small. This approach departs from the assumption that carbon gain trends are instantaneously optimal for all plants and. The presence of $J_{T}$ in equation \ref{eqn:objective} represents in opportunity cost, measured in carbon gain units, of depleting the soil of water. The Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ commonly referred to as the marginal water use efficiency (MWUE) and $f$ is the cost function obtained through equation \ref{eqn:soil_water_drydown}.

The optimal solution for the leaf stomatal conductance $g_l$ is obtained by solving the following simultaneous equations (Appendix A):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: dg}
    \frac{\partial H}{\partial g} = \frac{\partial A}{\partial g} + \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}=0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn: dlam}
    \frac{d\lambda}{dt} = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial x} = - \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial x},
\end{equation}
in conjunction with equation \ref{eqn:soil_water}.

The work here neglects high-frequency (sub-minute time scale) changes in environmental variables such as temperature and wind as well as those happening over multiple months such as changes in leaf nitrogen. The are thought not to have an appreciable effect on stomatal control over the timescale of a few weeks that is considered.

By tweaking the prescribed vulnerability curve for the same long-term strategy ($\Lambda$), and vice versa, it is possible to discern their effect on optimal stomatal behavior. 

We assume this is the global maximum

\subsection{Environmental data}

    \caption{Diurnal trends of vapor pressure deficit (VPD), temperature ($T$), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These are the averaged trends using measurements from the FLUXNET project at the Blodgett forest over 20 days starting from 5-29-2004 (the start of 4-months drought). These trends are repeated for the desired simulation duration.}
    \label{fig:environment}
\end{figure}

The model requires supplying environmental data acting as boundary conditions at the soil and leaf levels. These are the initial soil water content ($x_0$), vapor pressure deficit ($VPD$), incident leaf shortwave radiation ($R_l$), and temperature ($T$). We use the data provided by the FLUXNET project at the Blodgett forest. A drydown period starting on May 29, 2005 was chosen and the environmental variations over 20 days are averaged into one representative day. These conditions are then copied and tiled to however many days the optimization is running for. This allows isolating the plant hydraulic and strategy effects on stomatal behavior.

    \caption{Hydraulic limits on $\lambda$. Vulnerability Curve (VC) alterations affect the lower limit ($\lambda_{lower}$). These alterations consist of changing the normalizing pressure $\psi_{63}$ and the slope $s$ of the VC (see equation \ref{eqn:root_leaf}). All of the shown curves are subject to environmental conditions at 12:00 on 5-29-2004 in Blodgett Forest (combination of vapor pressure deficit, temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation). The upper limit ($\lambda_{upper}$) is set at the point where $g_s=0$ because $g_s$ can never be negative.}
    \label{fig:lam_lower}
\end{figure}

As previously described, root-to-leaf plant hydraulics are prescribed through a Vulnerability Curve (VC). By setting an upper limit on $E$ and therefore $g_s$, the VC sets a lower limit on the value of the marginal use efficiency $\lambda$ (figure \ref{fig:lam_lower}) because of the inverse relation between $g_s$ and $\lambda$ (equation \ref{eqn:control}). An upper limit on $\lambda$ is set at $g_s=0$ because $g_s$ cannot be negative (equation \ref{eqn:control}). As the soil moisture decreases and the soil water potential gets more negative, the leaf is constrained to higher $\lambda$ while the upper limit maintains a constant value. A more stringent lower limit applies when the plant is more vulnerable to embolism spread as indicated by a lower $\psi_{63}$. That vulnerable plants are constrained to more efficient modes of water use means that they can only afford more conservative water use strategies (WUS) as will be discussed.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
         \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{Fig3.pdf}   
    \end{center}
    \caption{Half-hourly (black) and midday (red) trends of stomatal conductance ($g_s$) with a) time ($t$) and b) soil water potential ($\psi_x$). Trends are shown for a resistant plant ($\psi_{63} = 3$ MPa), a vulnerable plant ($\psi_{63} = 1.9$ MPa), and a midrange plant ($\psi_{63} = 2.2$ MPa). Other plant and soil parameters are listed in the appendix. The plant is Pinus radiata and soil is sandy loam.}
    \label{fig:resistant_vulnerable_gs}
\end{figure}

This phenomenon is further shown in a simulation where plants use soil water over a period of $T=10$ days (figures \ref{fig:resistant_vulnerable_gs} and \ref{fig:resistant_vulnerable_lambda}). The soil water potential is preset by the boundary conditions to decrease from $x(0)=0.2$ to $x(T)=0.15$. There is no competition in this simulation to isolate plant water use from all possible effects. The half-hourly dynamics of $g_s$ show that the resistant plant ($\psi_{63}=3$) MPa maintain the same trend day to day. This is both due to the highly resistant xylem and the fact that environmental conditions are repeated day to day (figure \ref{fig:environment}). In contrast, the vulnerable plant ($\psi_{63}=1.9$) MPa starts at $t=0$ days with higher stomatal conductance than its resistant counterpart and progressively reduces its half-hour $g_s$ trend day to day. The contrast is clear when comparing the midday $g_s$ values against $t$ (figure \ref{fig:resistant_vulnerable_gs}a) and against $\psi_x$ (\ref{fig:resistant_vulnerable_gs}b). The larger sensitivity of the vulnerable plant's $g_s$ to $\psi_x$ qualify it as an isohydric species while the absent sensitivity of the resistant plant qualify it as an anisohydric species \citep{Hochberg2017}. As an intermediate case, the midrange species ($\psi_{63}=2.2$) MPa transitions from isohydric behavior when $\psi_x>-0.4$ MPa to anisohydric behavior.

The independent variable is time ($t$). Trends are shown for a resistant plant ($\psi_{63} = 3$ MPa), a vulnerable plant ($\psi_{63} = 1.9$ MPa), and a midrange plant ($\psi_{63} = 2.2$ MPa). Other plant and soil parameters are listed in the appendix. The plant is Pinus radiata and soil is sandy loam. This figure and figure \ref{fig:resistant_vulnerable_gs} correspond to the same simulation.}
    \label{fig:resistant_vulnerable_lambda}
\end{figure}

This contrast in behavior is driven solely by plant hydraulics (figure \ref{fig:resistant_vulnerable_lambda}). As the soil dries and $\lambda_{lower}$ increases, it crosses the half-hourly trend in $\lambda$ for the 3 species shown but earlier for more vulnerable ones (higher $\psi_{63}$). During the crossing intervals, plant hydraulics, as limited by the VCs, drive plant water use and induces the sensitivity of $g_s$ to drying soil. Because this crossing happens earlier for the vulnerable plant, it has to resort to more aggressive water use (lower $\lambda$) to achieve the same water use as prescribed by the boundary conditions. This underscores the disadvantage of having to prescribe the initial and terminal soil moisture as boundary conditions as priori. If the resistant plant can afford to be more aggressive and be more competitive than the vulnerable plant in the same environment, then a different formulation that take WUS into account is warranted. In fact, the total carbon assimilation over the 10-day period for the resistant plant is 3.10 mol m$^{-2}$ compared to 3.02 mol m$^{-2}$ for the vulnerable plant indicating a negligible competitive advantage. This is also apparent comparing the PLC at $t=10$ days of the resistant plant of 81\% compared to the vulnerable plant's 83\%. The widely used Hamiltonian integrates both carbon assimilation and the carbon cost of using water (Appendix B):
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:Hamiltionian}
    H = A + \lambda f_e.
\end{equation}
For the resistant plant , the integral of the Hamiltonian over the 10-day period is 0.78 mol m$^{-2}$ whereas it is 0.80 mol m$^{-2}$, a negligible difference. However, if one equates the amount of time above a certain threshold PLC to plant water stress, then one would be interested in observing that the vulnerable plant spends 8 days above a PLC$=50\%$ compared to the resistant plant's 2 days (figure S1).

A terminal gain term that is proportional to the terminal soil moisture $x(T)$ is now used in the objective (equation \ref{eqn:terminal_gain}). The boundary conditions are now $x(0)=0.2$ as before and $\lambda=36.3$ mol m$^{-2}$ for all three plants defined as in the previous simulation. 
% The former of these two effects is shown in figure \ref{fig:lam_lower} where the lower bound of $\lambda$ ($\lambda_{lower}$) is plotted as a functions of soil water potential. This arises from the solution of equation \ref{eqn: dg} upon replacing A using equation \ref{eqn:A_noci}. The solution provides an inverse functional relationship between $g_l$ and $\lambda$. At every $\psi_x$, equation \ref{eqn: mass_cons} is maximized to obtain an upper bound on $g_l$ which translates into a lower bound on $\lambda$. Because the maximum possible transpiration rate $E$ decreases as $\psi_x$ increases, $\lambda_{lower}$ increases with $\psi_x$.

% The latter of these two effects is imposed through equation \ref{eqn: dlam}. In the simple case where no uncontrolled losses from the soil are present, $f=-E$ and therefore $\frac{d\lambda}{dt}=\lambda \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}$. Taking the partial derivative by $x$ of equation \ref{eqn: mass_cons} yields the following positively valued equation:
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = g_p \Big(-\frac{\partial \psi_x}{\partial x}\Big) \Big[\frac{1}{2} \frac{s}{\psi_{63}} \Big(\frac{\psi_p}{\psi_{63}}\Big)^{s-1} (\psi_l-\psi_x) + 1\Big]
% \end{equation}


\section{Discussion}

The purpose of this work is to elucidate the connection of stomatal response to plant hydraulics and water-use strategy. Plant hydraulics was shown to set a lower limit for the marginal water-use efficiency ($\lambda$) whereas the upper limit is set by a ratio of atmospheric supply of carbon to atmospheric demand of water (figure \ref{fig:lam_lower}).

Connecting the concepts of isohydry and anisohydry to plant hydraulics represents a crucial next step toward improving stomatal response modelling. 

There is evidence for the evolutionary coordination between hydraulic traits and photosynthetic rate \citep{Scoffoni2016}. 

Fact that $psi_l$ only increases indicates irreversability in PLC.
