\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}[b]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{Long_Drought_Fig.jpg}
    \caption{Results of a 60-day drought simulation where at time $t=0$, soil moisture $x(0) =0.25$ for the gradual and resistant VC (figure 2 of the main text). The terminal marginal water use efficiency is set at $\lambda(60) = 1$ mmol mol$^{-1}$. Other parameters have the same values as those in table 1 in the main text except $Z_r = 1$m. The competitive water sinks are soil free drainage and competing plants with similar vulnerability curves (VCs) and water use strategy (WUS) to those modeled. The competing plants have access to only 20\% of the root zone water of each modeled plant. a) Midday trends of stomatal conductance ($g_s$) with $t$ and b) midday $\lambda$ with $t$. c) Midday carbon assimilation rate ($A$) and d) midday transpiration rate ($E$) with $t$. e) Midday $g_s$ and f) midday leaf water potential $\psi_l$ with soil water potential $\psi_x$.}

\begin{figure}[b]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{PLC_cica.jpg}
    \caption{Trends of a-1,b-1) midday ratio of internal to atmospheric carbon concentration $c_i / c_a$ and of a-2,b-2) midday percent loss of conductance (PLC) of the combined soil-root-stem-leaf continuum with soil water potential $\psi_x$. Panel A refers to the simulation shown in figure 4 of the main text where no competition or soil drainage was present. Panel B refers to the simulation shown in figure 5 of the main text where both competition and soil drainage were present. These results also compare the three different vulnerability curves (VCs) plotted in figure 2 of the main text.}

%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and logos.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%%  NB logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%


%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
